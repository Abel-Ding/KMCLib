This is of course no guarantee that there are none left to be found. So if you find any bugs or issues, or if you have suggestions for improvements, please let me know.\r\n\r\n### Obtain a copy\r\nThe program is distributed under the GPLv3 license and can be obtained from the *KMCLib* git repository https://github.com/leetmaa/KMCLib/releases/tag/v1.0\r\n\r\n### Use *KMCLib* in your own research\r\nIf you would be interested to use this code in your research and need any assistance, or if you are interested in collaborations, please don't hesitate to send me an e-mail: leetmaa@kth.se\r\n\r\n\r\nMikael Leetmaa, May 6 2014\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
