##v1.0-b1 (Deceber 3 2013)
KMCLib is now in version 1.0 BETA. We are fairly confident that the code works as intended and we have started using it in our own research. Before you start using the code in *your* research you should be aware that there is still room for minor updates and improvements before the first official release later this year. We will keep updating with more usage examples, more analysis functionality and a more complete manual, but there could also eventually be some minor changes to the API. The list of known issues is very short and involves nothing that affects the outcome of the simulations, but if you happen to find any bugs or issues, or if you have suggestions for improvements, please let me know.
