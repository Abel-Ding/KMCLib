        Constructor for the KMCProcess.

        :param coordinates: The local coordinates, corresponding to the lattice
                            positions of the surrounding of the center where
                            the process will be preformed.

        :param elements_before: The elements, as a list of strings,
                                before the process is preformed.
                                This list of elements will be used to match the
                                local surroundings of each center in the
                                simulation, to determine at which sites the
                                process can be performed.

        :param elements_after: The elements, as a list of strings,
                               after the process is preformed.
                               This list of elements will be used to update the
                               local surrounding of the site where the process
                               is performed.

        :param basis_sites: The basis sites in the lattice at which the process
                            can possibly be applied. Only if the length of this
                            list is 1 can implicit wildcards be used for the
                            matching.

        :param implicit_wildcards: A flag to indicate if implicit wildcards
                                   should be used in the matching when there
                                   are more sites in the local geometry on the
                                   lattice than given in the coordinates and
                                   element lists to specify the process. This
                                   keyord only takes effect if the basis_sites
                                   list has the length 1, i.e. that the process
                                   can only be applied to on specific basis
                                   site in the primitive cell.
